So there is a m * n matrix which is filled with some numbers.
The numbers on each box are points.

There is ship on some m,n location.
The ship can only sink down (direct down, left diagnol or right diagnol)

Find the max points that the ship can attain, if it starts from m,n

  		<--- Y -------->
  		
  			0  1  2  3  4
  
 ^		0 	1  2  3  4  5
 |		1 	6  7  8  9  10
 x		2 	11 12 13 14 15
 |		3 	16 17 18 19 20
 |		4 	21 22 23 24 25
 
 
 If ship is at a location 2,1 then it can move to 3,0 ; 3,1 ; 3,2 and so on
 
 While traversing the paths many of the locations are repeated, so DP can also be used
